# psnet_util

## Description

These scripts are used by myself to enable and disable network interface on Win10 for my working environment. Use it on *escalated* powershell command.

## Usage

Just run the script on escalated environment. There is confirmation if you are going to disable or enable the network.

## Distribution

Feel free to pull, change the script that suite you. It's free like free beer (if any).
